GER_german_partisans: "Anti-Partisan Campaign"
GER_german_partisans_desc:0 "The Red Revolution of February 14th, which destroyed the old German order and forced traitorous reactionaries to retreat from mainland Germany, has bought new problems and challanges to the new Socialist state. For years now, we have faced a systematic opposition from partisans still loyal to anti-communist cause, and although forced into the forests and mountains during the Fall Schwarz, we were unable to completely destroy them and their leadership. In the last few months, the partisans have become highly active once again. With German Republic facing more internal problems than before, this might be our last chance to get them, before they get to us...\n Strength of the Reactionary Partisans in the South: §R[?Root.southern_partisan_strenght]%§!. \n Strength of the Reactionary Partisans in the North: §R[?Root.northern_partisan_strenght]%§!.
