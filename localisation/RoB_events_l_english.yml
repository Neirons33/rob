 election.4.a:0 "Rather them than the communists!"
 election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.5.a:0 "Rather reform than revolution!"
 election.5.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.6.t:0 "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d:0 "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."
 election.6.a:0 "We will work with the fascists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 election.6.b:0 "Joining with the communists, we can facilitate social change."
 election.6.c:0 "A minority government, although weak, is preferable."
 election.7.t:0 "Fascists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.7.d:1 "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.7.a:0 "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 election.7.b:0 "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 election.8.t:0 "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d:0 "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 election.8.a:0 "We should embrace our common causes."
 election.8.b:0 "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."
 election.11.t:0 "Election: Fascist Majority"
 election.11.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.11.a:0 "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."
 election.11.b:0 "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 election.12.t:0 "Election: Communist Majority"
 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.12.a:0 "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 election.12.b:0 "We must stop them before they abolish every sign of dissenting thought!"
 election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

 election.13.b:0 "We cannot rely on fascists to develop and protect [Root.GetName]."
 election.14.t:0 "Election: Wartime Exception"
 election.14.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."
 election.14.a:0 "Elections will be held as usual."
 election.14.b:0 "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 election.15.t:0 "Election: Government Contested"
 election.15.d:0 "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."
 election.15.a:0 "This crisis of trust is highly unfortunate."
 election.15.b:0 "Let the political landscape shift to keep the people united."
 election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 election.17.a:0 "Splitters!"
 political.1.t:0 "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.1.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a communist coup."
 political.1.b:0 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 political.1.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a communist uprising."
 political.2.t:0 "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.2.a:0 "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 political.2.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 political.6.b:0 "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 political.7.t:0 "Fascism on the Rise"
 political.7.d:1 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.7.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a fascist coup."
 political.7.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.7.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.13.a:0 "We can discuss this internally for a start."

 political.14.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 political.16.a:0 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 political.16.b:0 "Let the people be heard."
 political.17.t:0 "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a:0 "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b:0 "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t:0 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a:0 "Suppress this hateful movement!"

 political.19.t:0 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

 political.20.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot.

The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."

 political.25.d:0 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.

Stalin has made himself an icon, but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion.

Documents acquired by the NKVD have implicated several high-ranking officers as not only traitors, but spies. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is among the most prominent of the suspects, and one Stalin is keen to rid the army of. Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."

The charges are also more extensive than previously, including decade-old plots to murder Soviet leaders and sell the Union to its enemies.\n\nThe fact that the NKVD themselves are now among the targets of the purge has in a sense brought the proceedings in full circle. Threats and beatings have led to many confessing to all charges, even the most outlandish ones. The leading defendants face execution."

What is known is that what he feared eventually came to pass. Today, Leon Trotsky reemerged as having returned from his exile, and with the support of several influential party members and NKVD officers, launched a coup overthrowing Stalin's rule.\n\nThe former General Secretary was attacked in his home with an ice axe, and was swiftly executed along with several of his supporters. Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev.

 bolshevik_russia.1.d:0 "The Russian Revolutionary spirit was born in 1905, when the industrial parts of Russian Empire exploded in a anti-monarchist and socilaist revolutions. However, it was brutally put down, resulting in a wide-spread disdain of socialism, except the industrial centers of the Russian Empire. This spirit manifested itself during the latter stages of Great War. Russian Soviet Republic, the republic of Russian proleteriat, was born in 1917, after the father of revolution, Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the bourgeoisie dictatorship in Petrograd, igniting the flames of Russian Civil War - A war that proved to be disastorus for all sides invloved. Initially, during the late 1917 and early 1918, Bolsheviks achieved moderate support from the working class in Western Russia, and the reactionary movement looked unstable, and was being teared appart from inside. The Red Guards pushed to the South, West, East and North, decimating the reactionary forces. Despite the early success, the Red Guards, being a voluntary organization, quickly bled in the green fields of Russia, and the Bolshevik offensive stopped. Reactionaries got back on their feet, and during the fall of 1918, forced the Red Forces out of Siberia and Northern Russia. At the end of 1918, "War Communism" was instituted by the socialist government, forcing conscription and making an "Army-First" policy with regards to the social and economic spheres of Russian society. With the advent of 1919, Bolshevik Army was facing difficult struggles in Western Russia, being forced back by the various independence movements, and bourgeoisie forces. At the same time, they seized notable parts of Siberian railway. This success wasn't long, as the need of reinforcments in Europe stalled the offensive in Siberia. In July of 1920, an all-out attack on the West started. It is estimated, that around 440 000 Red Army soldiers died. The attack, called the Summer Offensive, failed miserably, and Tukhachevsky and Jukums got executed. This was the beggining of the stalemate, as similar offensives on both sides became a regular thing. In 1922, A reactionary offensive cut the Siberian units from the main Soviet forces, and reached the encircled White forces on the Northern Russia, who were kept alive only by supplies form Entente. At the end of 1922, the Bolshevik economy and army was in shambles, as millions hadby that point perished in the flames of war. By June of 1923, the reactionary movement had fallen apart, and libertarian socialists, disilusioned by the Soviet government, rose up in the South Russia, ultimately forcing the Bolshevik forces out in 1926, shortly after the death of Lenin. The new governemnt reformed the economy of the Bolshevik state into a market socialist one, and signed a peace deal with partisans in the South. "War Communism" was abolished, and the focus was layed on the civilian economy. In 1934, Bolsheviks stand alone...  "

Any attempts by "Old Bolsheviks" to stop it were unsuccesful, as they gradually lost their influence in the Soviet government. NEP esentially liberalized markets, leaving only the most vital sectors of industry under the control of government, and others only had to abide the central plan. However, this change of policy created a new class of wealthy peasants and bourgeoisie. In the past few days, few of the most influential farmers in South of our country have declared, that the central plan is unjust, and thus, they will stop the transference of the grain from the next year onwards."

Despite opposition of more moderate socialists, Vlaslov portrays it as a true succession of the Leninist thought, and the next step for Russian people. The leading core of the organization has earned nickname “Vlaslov’s Group”. It has become a significant force in politics of Bolshevik regime, and is mainly supported by veterans of the civil war. Vlaslov’s group are strong supporters of militarism, authoritarianism and Russian nationalism, seeing the Bolshevik state as an tool to futher Russian interests. This evening, the main building of SORV in the rural Russia was attack by a group of heavily armed men, aiming to take out the leading figures of the organization.In the following thirty minutes, a firefight ensured, in which the attackers were eventually expeled from the building, and forced to retreat.

Apparently, for the next few hours, painful screams were heard from the room in which the man was kept. Shortly after midnight, Blokhin came out of the room, with his hands and face covered in blood, and gave location to the investigators. Location appeared to be an old, pre-war military camp in the forests in Smolensk. When unit of Red Guards arrived to the place, a brief firefight broke out with the partisans present there. 36 of them were killed and another 12 taken hostage.

 russian_republic.1.d:0 "The story of Russian Democratic Republic began in 1919, when advancing Red Army units cut off units of the reactionary Northern Army, thus effectively splitting war effort of anti-bolsheviks in Northern Russia in half. The next few years proved to be difficult for the defenders against Bolshevik horde, and only survived thanks to the help provided by Entente, however, thanks to supplies from West, and sheer willpower, reactionaries held. Years slowly passed, and Northern Front seemed to be the quietest in the blood river that was Russian Civil War, as both sides had their eyes on other targets. Military Action resumed in 1922, when the weakened Red forces among Trans-Siberian railway were destroyed in the last big offensive by the Reactionary forces, and units, that were encircled almost three years ago, rejoined with their brothers in arms, however, the reactionary efforts to destroy Red units on the Central Siberia proved to be fruitless, mainly due to the rough terrain, climate and successful defense on the Bolshevik side. In 6.June, 1923, Anti-Bolshevik "Movement", if you could call it that by this point, collapsed completely, as talks between the various leaders only achieved unfortunate anger in the reacionary leadership. In the following months, chaos accross what was formely Russia, ensured. Russian Democratic Republic was proclaimed on a dark and cold night, at Kazan, between 10th and 11th November of 1923. It was build as a presidential republic, with the State Duma acting as a parliament, directly elected by the citizens of the republic, and keeping president of the state in check. The support for the government of the republic is secured by Grigory Afanasyevich Verzhbitsky with his 1st Northern Russian Army, and the new state is founded upon conservative and capitalist ideals. However, reality soon catched optimistic citizens of the Russian Republic unprepared. The new state was unable to liquidate power of the great nobles, military officials, landlords and factory owners, and it soon reflected on to the economy of the nation, as more than fourty percent of the population lives under the poverty line in 1934, with unemployment, occasional limited famines, suicides and general criminalities being common in the lands of Russian Republic. President of republic, Vasily Maklakov, is fulfilling his third term, and is massively unpopular among the people, as the Elections of 1935 arrive. The direct consequence of unpopular government is the low voter turnout, standing at just thirty percent. As such, anti-democratic forces are fairly popular in the instable nation, and the socialist threat outside it's borders still stand strong - stronger than the republic, anyways. The Russian army is failing to corruption, their organization is decaying, and there is a ongoing insurgency in South of the country, made by Mari separatists.

 russian_republic.11.d:0 "When the evening slowly set on the Russian Republic, calm was nowhere to be found, as thousands upon thousands of both former and active soldiers, organized into their respective units, laid siege of the government buildings. In a swift action, all politicians of liberal and social democratic parties were rounded up, and although there are some reports of missing persons coming back from the rural countryside, where AfR units acted relatively unchecked, most of them were imprisioned, rather than executed. After all major areas were under control, Pavel Bermont drove into the city, both greeted and looked at in fear, and formally disbanded State Duma, proclaiming himself as the acting leader of Russian Republic. As the new regime is supported by the army and war veterans, any unrest or action against it seems hopeless. So far, it's unclear wheter Bermont, himself a rumored monarchist, aims to recreate Russian Empire, or stay in power himself, effectively making Russian Republic into a reactionary, anti-bolshevik and military dictatorship.

 russian_republic.13.d:0 "As the new government has proven to be unable to deal with internal attacks against it again, and the reforms of it has failed miserably due to opposition from both Russian Union and reactionaries, the people no longer have belief in ideals of liberalism and social-democracy, and have taken matters into their own hands. The reports from most of the major cities are comming in, and everywhere the government buildings are burning to the sound of overwhelming cries of support for the violence. The power of the new government is on it's last legs. "
 russian_republic.13.a:0 "Oh God, not again"
 russian_republic.14.t:0 "Democratic Government Falls"
 russian_republic.14.d:0 "It seems, that the new government of Russian Democratic Republic has lost all of it's power over the population, as State Duma is building, and all talks between the elected representatives has ended for the foreseeable future.

 russian_republic.15.d:0 "With the advent of total anarchy, two main courses have been illuminated on the overall background of chaos. The first possible way to stop the massive anti-government rebbelion would be for the two main conservative powers to unite into one coalition -  the leftovers of Social Christian Party, that constituted the ruling party of the republic for last 12 years, and "All for Russia" the main reactionary organization in Russian Republic. "All for Russia" has massive support among army, so it would be possible to use their support base to finally bring stability to this God-forsaken country. The second option would be to put all hopes into the Russian Union, which has expanded their support and resources considerably in the last few months... "

"
 russian_republic.16.a:0 "Something big is coming"
 russian_republic.17.t:0 "Civil War!"
 russian_republic.17.d:0 "As the chaos reigned on, Russian Union chose to take matters into their own hands, seizing most of the more important locations in the Russian Republic. However, such an agressive move has provoked a reaction from the Social Conservative Party, with many of the members openly engaging in violence against paramilitaries of Vonsiatsky. Many former generals and politicians are calling for support against the new regime, even attracting many army units. While it's expected that this anti-Vonsiatsky revolt will be crushed, and at it's core, it's more of a uprising than actual civil war, it's undoubtedly is going to put a scar of the already exausted population.

 prussia.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of East Germany can be said as being founded on February 14th, with the start of the German civil war which was fought by the spartacists and monarchists. Sadly for the king, fate had decided otherwise and the communists were winning decisevely. They were holding until the first army became encircled near the Dutch border and started using partisan tactics. The monarchists did have some successes. They managed to evacuate everything east of Berlin and the navy remained loyal to the king, which ended with them and the remnants of their military fleeing to Prussia, vowing to continue the war, but the war had been de facto over. No more fighting had been happening with the exception of partisan bands which were being rapidly overran. Soon after returning to Prussia Kaiser Wilhelm II quickly resigned leaving Wilhelm III to rule. While definetly much more stable than their brothers in the west they couldn't exactly call it a perfect situation. The minorities(mainly Lithuanians under Vydūnas) are quickly rising since they now make a huge number of the population. This has led to germanization efforts to being almost completely stopped and near daily street fights between them and German nationalists. Some rumors state that that, however, will change as the pelekists and Lithuanians might hold a meeting and if united they would pose a serious treat for Germany. On the other side there is a large pelekist movement that's quickly rising... The fate of the Kaiser remains unknown"
 prussia.1.a:0 "Heil dir im Siegerkranz!" 
 prussia.2.t:0 "Wilhelm II's Birthday!"
 prussia.2.d:0 "Wilhelm II, despite no longer Kaiser, still holds a great importance to the kingdom. As January 27th is fastly approaching the royal family is preparing for the previous Kaiser birthday. Many questions still remain however, like how big should the celebration be. Many people such as the military leaders advocate for a much safer small celebration at home while others, such as ex-Kaiser Wilhelm II and Kaiser Wilhelm III advocate for a large celebration with him talking to the German people."
 prussia.2.a:0 "Let them celebrate their birthday's like they wish"
 prussia.2.b:0 "Their safety is the biggest priority."
 prussia.3.t:0 "Kaiser Wilhelm III killed!"
 prussia.3.d:0 "Today during the celebrations of Wilhelm II's birthday in Königsberg,  at 14:28, a sudden blaze appeared in the crowd, that had gathered to view the speech of the German monarch. A quick bullet, unstoppable and uncompromisable, fled right in the the direction of Kaiser. Moments later, the figurehead of the Prussian state lied on the ground, in a puddle of blood, that was slowly flowing from his body. As crowd went into a total hysteria, and members of royal security rushed to take down the attacker, Kaiser was quickly rushed to the closest hospital. \n However, it was to late. Few minutes after midnight, Kaiser of East Germany, Wilhelm the Third, was officially proclaimed dead, with the Prussian Reichstag officials taking on the control of the nation. Only the God knows, what will this bring for our beloved homeland…"
 prussia.3.a:0 "Kaiser Wilhelm III is no more..."
 prussia.4.t:0 "Pelekist Clash"
 prussia.4.d:0 "Today at 12:15, few regiments of Lithuanians clashed with German Pelekists in Tilsit. What started as a brawl soon developed into a full on gunfight. It is unknown who started firing, as both sides have easy access to guns. The Lithuanian side claimed, that before the attack, they had been just minding their business, before the Germans started to attack people, with the German side claiming the same. Two big crowds formed and clashed. 31 people were killed, while many more were rushed to hospitals. Probably many more Germans and Lithuanians would have died, if it had not been for the local  Poles attacking both sides, which managed to unite them. After overwhelming Pelekist numbers from both Lithuanian and German sides crushed the Polish militants,  both sides parted ways. This was a dark day indeed for both Thule Gesellschaft and Lietuvninku Taryba. This, in turn, has forced many Pelekists from both sides to call for a union between two groups, to stop the unnecessary violence between them, and to focus on enemies against the greater Pelekist ideal.

 prussia.6.d:0 "Today at 15:44 Rosenberg, Hess and Vydūnas met at Memel to discuss the situation in Prussia. The conversation was long and productive, with no fights breaking out. The main topics discussed were on the questions of Jews, Lithuanians, the Kaiser, communists and many others, at one point divulging into a conversation about esoterism between Vydūnas and Rosenberg until Hess reminded them to return to more serious matters. At the end, they all agreed on one thing: They must unite if they wish to be successful..."

 prussia.7.t:0 "Pelekists Banned!"
 prussia.7.d:0 "After the bloody fighting on the streets of Tilsit the Kaiser has ordered both groups to be banned, with their leaders and supporters to be removed from any position they might've had before. Many commanders are replaced and even more politicians are being arrested. Hess commited suicide to avoid arrest while Rosenberg fled to Estonia. Vydūnas was arrested but sent to Lithuania after president's Stulginskis request to have the poet sent back home."

 prussia.8.d:0 "With the death of our monarch, the main organ engaged in the ruling of the Prussian State has been the Prussian Reichstag. Mostly just meant as a helping hand to the Kaiser, it started to work against him more and more in the recent years. As such, conflict, resignations, both forced and voluntary were a common occurrence. Compromised mostly of powerful nobles, close friends of Kaiser, top capitalists and few popular politicians, it is now the most important group in the lands of East Prussia. \n Political debate has been raging on for days now, with no clear winner. While more liberal elements call for a democratic system, with free elections, many former soldiers and nobles are advocating a system based upon ideals of Prussian Militarism, where the leading role would belong to the army. It is unclear, what the future hold for the small state on the Baltic Sea, and the Royal Family is kept under strict protection by the security services..."

Today, that day has arrived, and it is now the day when the German, Polish and Lithuanian people will go to the voting ballots and decide who will be the party that will shape the future of our country. While no party has been projected to achieve total support, each party has a decent chance with the SPD, DDP and DNVP leading in the polls.

The coup was bloodless, despite police and soldiers being sent to deal with them, with a battalion led by a Lithuanian named Zygfrydas Milius switching sides, and soon being followed by many more. The police, after seeing that the military is with the Pelekists quickly ran away leaving the path to the Reichstag open for Rosenberg, Vydūnas and Hess. The Reichstag gave them power under fear. No action could save their lives though, and every politician, and even some nobles, who were believed to be opposed to Pelekist regime, were quickly executed in a mass action all over country. The flag of Swastika now flies everywehre, igniting fear into it’s enemies... "

 prussia.12.d:0 "After the successful coup, many questions need to be asked. Under Rosenberg's supervision a large group of Pelekist leaders has been summoned to talk about the future of the nation in the former Reichstag. Many questions will be decided during it. WIll the Lithuanian faction win? Will Hess win or will Rosenberg win? It is not yet known."
 prussia.12.a:0 "What are we waiting for? Let's get to work!"
 prussia.13.t:0 "The question of the Lithuanians"
 prussia.13.d:0 "The first question raised by the great debate, is the fate of the Lithuanians. Vydūnas and his supporters argue that most Prussians are of Baltic origin, and thus they should be relithunized. Meanwhile Rosenberg is stating that Germans and Lithuanians are both Aryans and thus should be given equal rights in the newly created state. However, in Hess's opinion, Germanic people are clearly a superior race and must make this a land for only Germans. The debate isn't getting any calmer and it looks like some fights might start... But nonetheless a vote is started."
 prussia.13.a:0 "Vydūnas is the most correct here"
 prussia.13.b:0 "Rosenberg makes the best argument"
 prussia.13.c:0 "Hess cannot be wrong"
 prussia.14.t:0 "The question of the Poles"
 prussia.14.d:0 "The second question raised by the great debate is about the Polish, who make a sizable minority. Both Hess and Vydūnas have argued for years now, that the Poles must be repressed while Rosenberg argues that many Poles are as Aryan as Germans and Lithuanians. It isn't anywhere near as intense but the points are as good. A vote will soon happen..."
 prussia.14.a:0 "Rosenberg is correct."
 prussia.14.b:0 "The Poles are merely invaders."
 prussia.15.t:0 "The Government"
 prussia.15.d:0 "The last topic of the great debate is on of how the state is ran. Hess and Vydūnas once again are united on this, with them stating that the nation must be led by a single strong leader (a king, based on ancient philosophy in the case of Vydūnas, and a Fuhrer in the case of Hess), with Rosenberg once again leading the other faction, calling for a great council of Pelekism to be formed with him as it's president."
 prussia.15.a:0 "We must have a single, strong, leader!"
 prussia.15.b:0 "The council is the only choice!"
 prussia.16.t:0 "Vydūnas becomes leader!"
 prussia.16.d:0 "After much debate, the pro-Lithuanian faction had barely won the debate by a single vote. This even managed to cause a fight between the supporters of Hess and Vydūnas but was soon calmed down by nearby guards. The next day Vydūnas is announced as the leader of the nation to the world, and a massive ceremony is staged to happen soon. Lithuania was the first to send congratulations, and president Aleksandras Stulginskis promised to take part in the ceremony."
 prussia.16.a:0 "Lietuva tėvynė mūsų!"
 prussia.17.t:0 "Hess becomes the fuhrer"
 prussia.17.d:0 "After much debate, the pro-German faction had barely won the debate by a single vote. This even managed to cause a fight between the supporters of Hess and Vydūnas but was soon calmed down by nearby guards. The following day Hess's victory was announced and a large celebration is to be staged. Nordic Pelekist leaders promise to visit the ceremony."
 prussia.17.a:0 "Congratulations to der fuhrer!"
 prussia.18.t:0 "President Rosenberg"
 prussia.18.d:0 "After much debate, the Rosenberg faction has won the debate by a landslide. The following day Rosenberg's victory was announced and a large celebration is to be staged. Many foreigners are invited, such as the Lithuanian president or nordic Pelekists and even the other candidates promise to take part in the ceremony."
 prussia.18.a:0 "The best choice!"
 prussia.22.d:0 "Fuhrer Hess walked slowly, as his guards in green uniforms held their weapons even firmer, taking a deep breath, looking like stone giants from ancient Norse legends. Hess walked on a balcony, as mid-day Sun shined right into his eyes. Getting disoriented for a few seconds, he firmly griped the fences. "Today, a new morning is rising in Europe", he started speaking to the crowd gathered before him, "and that morning is nothing less than a full Aryan victory!"His words were getting louder, as the crowd got more and more energized. "WE MUST look to the North, to the homeland of our ancient forefathers, the lands mentioned in Vēdas and ages-old Aryan texts perserved in Iranian mountains! The people bringing end to this Dark AGe, which slowly creeps upon the Aryan more and more, won't be the Polish! They won't come from Hungary, from Italy or Russia! Only we, the sons of North, can do it!", he loudly exclaimed. The crowd interupted into a total ecstasys."As such, today we announce a new, Germanic order, that shall bring and end to this sinister time!" Hess finished, as crowd was cheering."
 prussia.23.d:0 "It was a cool evening, when Fuhrer Hess had to adress his fellow party members once again. Welcomed with cheers and greets from his comrades, he walked on platform, with the Swastika flag calmy flying behind him. "It's finally time, to regain our freedom,"he started speaking, as the audience was grabbed by total silence. "No more will the soul of Aryan man be poisoned by Semitic influences. It is time, we set ourselves free, spiritualy, and physicaly". Later that evening, SS squads were seen arresting many priests, tearing down Christian symbols seen as too Semitic, and hanging flag of Swastika in all churches found in Prussia. Everyone protesting was swiftly executed... "
 prussia.24.d:0 "The Door opened, and Rosenberg walked in, just to find his comrades, Vydūnas and Hess, staring at each other in distrust. He sat down right in front of both of them. \n\n "Gentlemen, I believe it's time to forget our differnces, and to let our petty national differences go.", Rosenberg said. The disscusion dragged well into early morning. However, it wasn't unsuccesful - in the following days, all antagonism between conflicting parties miracously stopped. It's not known, how Rosenberg achieved this, or what deals were made behind the closed doors in Konigsberg, but the fact is clear as a day - internal diffrences in the Pelekist government are no more."
 prussia.25.d:0 "Rosenberg was sitting at his working desk, and slowly drinking his evening tea, as a paper folder grabbed his attention. It was relativily old, with the date being 1926.06.03. In it, was a collection with his writtings on Christianity and European Paganism, dating back to his work in the newspaper of Thule Gesellschaft. He was getting more and more immersed and disconnected from the outside world, the longer he read his own writtings. \n\nIt was already morning, when he finally put down the papers, which had bothered him all night. He woke up few hours later, feeling unsatissfied with his sleep, and decided to go out for a walk. Upon returining, all doubts had left his head, and vision for Germanic State was clearer than ever before."
 prussia.26.d:0 "It was a slow midday in the Prussian State, only getting interupted by a occasional car passing by. At the same time, the Prussian Pelekist Council was full with life - every last one of Rosenberg's comrades was summoned in capital, to discuss important matters of state \n\n"My fellow warriors!",Rosenberg exclaimed,"The time has come to finally bring back that, which was stolen from us! Today, right here, I propose the creation of entirely new Aryan aristocracy!" The audience was buzzing like a massive bee swarm, only calmed by Rosenberg himself. "As such, all old titles of the degredated Prussian reactionaries will be abolished, giving a way for a new form of goverment. A one by Aryans, for Aryans!"\n\nThe proposal was passed with 120-0, with everyone being in full support of Rosenberg's idea. In practice, this will mean a Neo-Feudal system, led by local nobles, who will be picked out of the Prussian Pelekist Council, and who will have to adhere to mythical, thousands of years old rites, found in works such as Rigaveda and Bhagavad Gita."
 prussia.27.d:0 "It was a dark, and cool night, as suddenly, a fire was lit, enlightening the black Prussian woods.Drums stared beating, and a group of 27 Lithuanians stood in a circle, with the fire, full of fire and energy, burning in the middle. They were all dressed in white robes, with only one of them having a red belt, decorated with Baltic symbols. It was Vydūnas. He stepped closer to fire, carrying a bowl with milk, honey, and rye bread. He slowly put it all in the fire, as other continued their ancient song. The fire sparkled, and the food slowly burned. Vydūnas looked up, right into midnight sky. \n\nEveryone was waiting for him to get ready, and start his speech. After a brief period, Vydūnas opened his mouth."Thousands of years ago, we were stripped from our spirituality, our rulling class was destroyed, and we were left wandering in the dark. No more, I tell you, as the Aryan has finnaly found his way to light again. For no longer will we be led by disgusting forms of government, created by human falsehoods - the power will return to the hands of Aryan Heroes and Philosophers!"\n\n Pelekist Council was promptly disbanded, and a Council of Brammans, refering to the name of old Baltic Priests, was put in it's place. Dovas Zaunius alongside 25 other members of Lithuanian-Prussian origin, now make up the main governing body of Rytprūsija."

france.1.t:0 "Third French Republic in 1934"
 france.1.d:0 "The Great War was a hard fought victory for the French people. Despite having nearly lost all of Paris, the French and allied forces pushed through Alsace and started a new offensive against the German war machine. Just because the French tri-color flew heroicallyover their captured German lands, the victory itself was much more hollow than it appeared to their western counterparts.\n\n Since the end of the conflicts, the French administration has seen a growing number of political radicalization. Both far left and far right groups have grown popularity en mass and it has begun to threaten both the people of France as well as the ideals of democracy which have been held so dear since the French Revolution. Some of these groups claim to be the champion of the workers and wish to revive the ideas of the Paris Commune from years before. Others wish to realize French identity and wish to see a rise of a new French empire. Either way, both of these radical political ideologies wish to dismantle the existing French democratic system. \n\nWith one of their greatest rivals, Germany, divided and humiliated France appeared to have the upper hand as far as a dominant power in mainland Europe. But after such recent political turmoil, it is unsure how long, or if France will continue to hold this title."

 france.2.t:0 "The Communist Question"
 france.2.d:0 "While the nationalist and right coalitions are dangerous, the left wing communistic parties are much more organized and have been seen as more “socially acceptable” by people who are against the current political situation. Which is why a new proposition of making these far left groups illegal has gained recent popularity in French parliament. The bill has also seen favoritism amongst both center and far right politicians and groups. \n\nIf the bill passes it will see a complete ban on any communistic or socialistic groups. Current accepted parties will be disbanded, and any new parities, rallies or far left wing activity will be met with shutdown by French law enforcement. Those against the bill may or may not agree with the communists, but they argue that suppression of political ideologies won’t fix the increasing radicalization. While those in favor claim that it is needed to protect us far left terror that threatens to destroy the French way of life. The out come is eventually reached and it appears…"

 france.3.t:0 "Pelekists March on Paris!"
 france.3.d:0 "Many of the members of right wing parties, including the far right Pelekist party are very upset and frustrated with the refusal to ban communist parties by the French government. As a result, a paramilitary branch known as the Gold Shirts was formed by the Pelekist party. These men, identifiable by their golden polos and shirts, have taken stocks of arms and distributed it amongst themselves forming militias all over the country. Even scarier though is that some military officials have even defected their posts and joined these hooligans. Claiming that the Pelekist cause cares more about the army than the government does or ever will. With the army nearly split between loyalists and Pelekists, the stage was set for complete political and military turmoil. In very early hours in the morning Gold Shirts and army defectors stormed various government buildings all over paris. Some Gold Shirts even flew the Pelekist party flag over the Eiffel Tower with the French flag being burned. \n\nThe army was called in to deal with the Pelekist foes but even with the loyalist armies, Pelekism is seen as more favorable by multiple generals, as it favors a militaristic state. This is something that the republic could never achieve amongst a democratic society. This could either be a chaotic riot by some far right extremists, or the beginning of a Pelekist French state."
 france.3.a:0 "The Army sides with Pelekists!"

 france.4.t:0 "French Military Crushes Radicals"
 france.4.d:0 "While the idea of a nationalistic and militaristic state does sound very appealing to many of the army’s more radical generals, the army decided to not side with the Pelekists. Rather they chose to stay loyal to the oath the took upon entering the French military. An oath of loyalty to prevse both the ideals of the republic and the republic itself. Those who stood against this ideal were removed and discharged from the military by the elites. With the army now almost purely in favor of the democratic government, the Pelekist cause now had no chance of any further radicalization of the current military."

It is said that self described “worker activist” Paul Ramadier hosted a meeting between various communist officials somewhere in the south of France. Leaders from all over the spectrum came to meet Mr. Ramadier in Paris. A crowd gathered around the Hôtel de Crillon where they met. Some supporters cheered on as party leaders entered the hotel while many others booed. Due to the meeting being a non political rally, it was deemed legal under the bill. However police were dispatched to break up any fights between radicals and to keep the police."

Both parties originally had very different views on how to run a state. Sorelians claim that the Pelekists are overly nationalistic and theocratic, whereas the Pelekists claim that the Sorelenists will eventually lead to a communistic state. But today these groups put aside their differences to discuss their common enemy of the left wing. Both sides agree that the vote to ban the parties should have been passed if it was not for so called “liberal intervention”. As far as what was discussed in detail at this meeting, was yet to be publicized by either party."

 spartakus_germany.8.d:0 "The first and most important part in this year's congress is given to economic disscusions. \n\nThe economy of Spartacist Germany is an weird one. While DIG, or German Industrial Society is the main planning organ of the nation, responsible for nation-wide economic plans, the implemention of the plans are left to local representatives of Spartakusbund. Meanwhile, in recent years, more anarchist-aligned communes have sprung up in urban districts and rural villages alike, which are effectively out of the reach by central government. This has led to unstable economic structure, which is no way prepared to face modern challenges.\n\n The first faction within the Spartakusbund, grouped together as "National Bolsheviks" propose to get rid of anarchist-aligned communes, heavily invest in agriculture and focus on centralizing such economic matters as armament production and resource excavation. \n\nSecond faction within Spartaksubund are the supporters of status-quo. In their view, the current economic policy is on the right path towards achieving full socialism. They want to keep the delicate balance between central state organs and local socialist initiative. \n\nThe third largest faction within the Spartakusbund is a coallition of various Libertarian socialists, such as fringe German Anarchist or Syndicalist groups, and people advocating for more liberal approach in general. They want to see German economy focusing solely on workers, in a democratic manner.\n\nThe voting starts. "

 spartakus_germany.9.d:0 "The second part of the German Congress is directed at the question of the armed forces. \n\nThe armed forces of Socialist Germany, just like it's economy, is an mix between rather decentralized structures and highly organised ones. Former war veterans and revolutionaries make up the bulk of NVA, providing it with the much required manpower and basic infantry. This part of military is often poorly equipped and trained. At the same time, there are multiple Rotkorp divisions under our command, which were the most elite troops during Great and Civil war. These Rotkorps have access to modern technologies, and are build with fast warfare in mind. \n\nThe National Bolshevik faction has been a strong advocate for larger centralization and expansion of the NVA, to bring the whole army up to a modern level, aiming to modernize NVA and reform it into a force capable of facing French or Italian armies in battlefields.\n\nMeanwhile, the Luxembourgist faction has opposed such expansion for a long time, rather aiming to build up a modern and technically advanced core, basing it off Rotkorps, seeing armored warfare as the next step for fighting doctrine. \n\nFinally, the Democrats, who haven't been really keen on massive military campaings across all of Europe, have put forwards a plan, which would shift the backbone of our army onto the hands of local defense forces, only keeping a small and agile force under direct government control.\n\nVotes are being casted."

Teachers, intellectuals, writters and journalists have been critical of our socialist system from the start, and regurally use their positions to undermine our policies.\n\nMost radical of the factions, National Bolsheviks, advocate for a total destruction of any harmful thought or intent found within our society. Not only pelekist and reactionary partisans in North and South would face death penality, but various thinkers imprisioned for anti-socialist positions too. We don't give allow our enemies to have guns, why allow them to have ideas? \n\nLuxembourgist faction has exclaimed for a long time, that this is only a transition phase, which will go away as time goes by. As such, they only want to see the current policies continued and larger warfare against partisan traitors. \n\nDemocrats have come out with a rather weird proposal. They propose reforming most of our enemies inside full time re-education camps, and only shooting them if they don't fit in even after exceptional pressure. They also support amnest for people with reactionary past, and long-imprisioned partisans and our opponents.\n\n Votes are being counted."

While currently there are large socialist movements in both France, United Kingdom and Italy, we cannot just wait for revolution to come magically. We are very isolated internationally, with only Wallonia standing by our side, after their socialist party achieved victory in the most recent elections. As such, we should make our position clear. \n\nNational Bolsheviks support the most limited form of expansion, only really wanting to unite former German lands, in which Germans make up the majority, avenging wrongs that were pressed upon us after the last war, and making Germany the continental power of mainland Europe. \n\nLuxembourgists, on the other hand, being international oriented, only see Germany as a vehicle, using which revolution can be brought to the whole world. Their imminent goals include desctruction of reactionary regimes around us, and destruction of French hegemony. \n\nDemocratic Socialists, while not being far behind Luxembourgists, are rather careful regarding military expansion, and would rather see other socialist movements achieving victory, with our covert support. \n\nPeople are voting.

Every district of our lands has their own representative, which is elected by local populace for 4 years, totaling at around 1000 people from whole of Germany, Once every seven years, every socialist local representative meets in Berlin, in All-German Congress such as this one, to vote on the most important questions of the socialist state, and on the people making up the Spartacist Council, which in a sense works similar to ministers in liberal democracies. Afterwards, all members of Council vote on a new Chairman, Chairman being the main leader at the top, with various powers, such as vetoing various projects of Council.\n\nNational Bolsheviks in the Congress have proposed expanding powers of the Chairman, to allow for a stronger, more centralized leadership, capable of dealing with various issues, which could arise any moment, especially in such circumstances as we find ourselves in. \n\nLuxembourgists, being the Status-Quo aren't keen on radical changes, and want to see continuation of current policies. \n\nDemocratic Socialist faction sees the Chairman position as a one-way ticket to dictatorship, and want to see powers of Chairman limited even more, if not abolished entirely. \n\nClock is ticking."

In his view, the next war will be won by artillery and infantyr, just like the last one. His plan would focus on expaning our artillery capabilities and hardening our infantry core.\n\nThe last plan, proposed by general Student, is the most ambitious one. If put into pratice, it would see NVA transformed into a massive, decentralized force, mainly meany for defense, while massivly expanding our special forces, which would be used for offensive operations.\n\nThe future of Germany lays in the hand of Chairman."

They detail important information regarding partisans and also information about the individual partisans, including their names. Soldiers have been ordered to visit their families and, depending on their mood, chose an execution. \n\nEntire families were slaughtered in ways ranging from a simple firing squad to them being tied to a tree with their own guts until they starved or bled out."

At first the animalism of the bandits had been working and managed to deal large loses, but then Panzer reinforcements arrived, which the partisans couldn’t effectively combat and thus were quickly routed. Among the dead bodies commander of local cell was found. The partisan situation has led to a zero-tolerance policy regarding supporters of the traitorous cause.

After that the public was shown the riches the state had gained from its interventions, which had amassed to quite the amount. After that he was led to the palace of the grand dukes, nearly destroyed by now and held an oath of soldiers and generals, all swearing loyalty to the new king, to defend him and their Lithuania by the name of Dundulis, a folk name for the Baltic god of thunder Perkūnas used by those deemed not worthy of the real name, and Jesus.\n\nAfter the elaborate ceremony, Visuomis held a speech, lasting for 3 hours, and he had ended it by taking an old sword, which he had claimed was the sword of Kęstutis, the last ruler of Lithuania to die a pagan, and swore an oath, to Perkūnas, that he shall lead Lithuania loyally under the example of his ancestors."
