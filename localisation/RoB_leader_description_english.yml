  POLITICS_Prince_Pedro_Gastao_of_Orleans_braganza_DESC:0 "Pedro III has been the king of Brazil ever since 1921, but sadly for him the inheritance of a once glorious empire is now nothing but a shity state. Pedro The Second had to make vast sacrafices in order to maintain power within the empire. The effects of Pedro's sacrafices have no been placed upon Pedro the III. Only time will tell if Pedro III reinvigorates Brazil, or if he gets overthrown by rebbelous republican cretans."
