 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Rivers Of Blood"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The war is over. A dark shadow casts above the poor people of Hungry, on all sides, enimies. Our once great people have been spread out, destroyed, and demoralized by our neighbors Romania, Slovakia, Croatia, and Serbia. The time of peace is luckly comming to a bitter end, only the blood of the enimies of the Magyar people will quench our thirst. The Hungarian peoples will be united, once and for all. Hosszú élő magyar!"
