 LIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once a powerful Grand Duchy, the modern state of Lithuania is a shadow of its former self. It may be a conservative democracy with a decent size for such a small state, but it is far from perfect. There are enemies on all sides with Prussians and Baltic Germans on their borders, various nationalist factions wishing to bring back the days of old and the general fear for the future, Lithuania is in a very precarious position. But perhaps this may all change with the following years to come"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Forged from the ashes of the Russian empire, a communist front has created a large sovereign territory to establish a Russian workers state. Following the collapse would see years of famine and starvation alongside crippling military defeat. But even after all of these hardships the communists in the north have shown they are yet to give up their determination and loyalty to their ideals of Marx. Only time will tell the future of the Bolsheviks, but one thing for certain is they are not ready to go into the ashheaps of history without a fight."
