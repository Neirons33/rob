  POLITICS_Prince_Pedro_Gastao_of_Orleans_braganza_DESC:0 "Pedro III has been the king of Brazil ever since 1921, but sadly for him the inheritance of a once glorious empire is now nothing but a shity state. Pedro The Second had to make vast sacrafices in order to maintain power within the empire. The effects of Pedro's sacrafices have no been placed upon Pedro the III. Only time will tell if Pedro III reinvigorates Brazil, or if he gets overthrown by rebbelous republican cretans."

  POLITICS_VISOUMIS_DESC:0 "Domas Šidlauskas, born on the 17th of August, 1878, known more by his pseudonym Visuomis, has ascended to the highest position of power in Lithuanian State, after childern of Jonas Beržanskis refused the throne. Since 1897, Visuomis has participated in various political and social Lithuanian organizations, while working in various newspapers, centred on Lithuanian and Baltic culture and religion,also briefly working in Riga during 1910.\n\nBeing fascinated by Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the idea of a Baltic State, based upon pre-Christian traditions, Visuomis has been an active participant in §RRomuva§! circles since early 1930s. Now, with his position within the Lithuanian State, it seems that his worldview will be fully implemented, based upon organic Baltic identity and Aryan "Paganism"."
  POLITICS_RADOLA_GAJDA_DESC:0 "Born in 14th of February, 1892, to a poor Montenegrin noble woman, and an Austro-Hungarian officier, Gajda started his military adventures at the age of 18, when he enrolled in compulsory military service. \n\nAfter leaving for Balkans, and rejoining the Austro-Hungarian Army at the start of the Great War, he was taken prisoner in 1915. Taken into custody, he soon found himself switching sides, and joining the Army of Montenegro. With the collapse of Montenegro, Gajda fled to Russia, and joined the Czechoslovak Legion.\n\nThe Legion soon realized their unfortunate situtation, being thrown into the horrors of Russian Civil War. Gajda successfully led defense against Reactionary attacks and Bolshevik partisan raids, inflicting significant casualties on the attackers during battle of Mias, which provided him with widespread respect among military ranks.\n\nAs the advance of Legion bogged down, Gajda was one of the first proposing creation of a new state, led by Legion's officers. Year after year, as he ascended in the Legion's hierarchy, his grip became firmier and stronger, as his opponents disappeared or were found dead in Siberian taiga.\n\nA strong anti-communist, anti-materialist and pan-Slavic nationalist, Gajda acquired heavily damaged copy of "La Mia Guerra" in 1928. Since then, he has only waited for the right moment, to come out with his grand vision for the battle-stranded Siberian legion."
